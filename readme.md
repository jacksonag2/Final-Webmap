This application was meant to help users gain insight into why specific areas of the country are experiencing climate change very differently from others.
As the map displays, although all states are affected by climate change and global warming, some are impacted significantly more than others.
Additionally, I wanted to show that, across the country, the areas experiencing some of the worst impacts of global warming (heat waves) are primarily in major cities, regardless of location.
The initial article that inspired me to create a webmap for this topic was a piece by the UCAR https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/climate-change-impacts/regional.
Although the article discusses the various potential effects of climate change, I believe I could better illustrate its impact by showing the locations affected across the country rather then how they would be affected.
Climate change is something that will effect us all one day, and it is something that needs to be not only stopped, but outright reversed. 
I chose this topic because I am aware of just how many people either deny climate change exists or think it's being overexaggerated or is something that should be political.
This is something that is already damaging our ecosystem and causing harm worldwide and as things stand they are not getting better.
